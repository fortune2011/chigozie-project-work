            <div>Joh 2:1  And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: </div>
            <div>Joh 2:2  And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. </div>
            <div>Joh 2:3  And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. </div>
            <div>Joh 2:4  Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. </div>
            <div>Joh 2:5  His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. </div>
            <div>Joh 2:6  And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. </div>
            <div>Joh 2:7  Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. </div>
            <div>Joh 2:8  And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. </div>
            <div>Joh 2:9  When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, </div>
            <div>Joh 2:10  And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. </div>
            <div>Joh 2:11  This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. </div>
            <div>Joh 2:12  After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days. </div>
            <div>Joh 2:13  And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, </div>
            <div>Joh 2:14  And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: </div>
            <div>Joh 2:15  And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; </div>
            <div>Joh 2:16  And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise. </div>
            <div>Joh 2:17  And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. </div>
            <div>Joh 2:18  Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? </div>
            <div>Joh 2:19  Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. </div>
            <div>Joh 2:20  Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? </div>
            <div>Joh 2:21  But he spake of the temple of his body.</div>
            <div>Joh 2:22  When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. </div>
            <div>Joh 2:23  Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. </div>
            <div>Joh 2:24  But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, </div>
            <div>Joh 2:25  And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man. </div>
