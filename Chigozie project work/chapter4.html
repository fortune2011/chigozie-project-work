           <div>Joh 4:1  When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, </div>
           <div>Joh 4:2  (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) </div>
           <div>Joh 4:3  He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:4  And he must needs go through Samaria. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:5  Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:6  Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:7  There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:8  (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) </div>
           <div>Joh 4:9  Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:10  Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:11  The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? </div>
           <div>Joh 4:12  Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? </div>
           <div>Joh 4:13  Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: </div>
           <div>Joh 4:14  But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:15  The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:16  Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:17  The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: </div>
           <div>Joh 4:18  For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:19  The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:20  Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:21  Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:22  Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:23  But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:24  God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:25  The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:26  Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:27  And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? </div>
           <div>Joh 4:28  The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, </div>
           <div>Joh 4:29  Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? </div>
           <div>Joh 4:30  Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</div>
           <div>Joh 4:31  In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:32  But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:33  Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat? </div>
           <div>Joh 4:34  Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:35  Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:36  And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:37  And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:38  I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:39  And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:40  So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:41  And many more believed because of his own word; </div>
           <div>Joh 4:42  And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:43  Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:44  For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:45  Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:46  So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:47  When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:48  Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:49  The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:50  Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:51  And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:52  Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:53  So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. </div>
           <div>Joh 4:54  This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee. </div>
