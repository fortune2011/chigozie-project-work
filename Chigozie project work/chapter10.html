        <div class="chapter10">  
           <div>Joh 10:1  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:2  But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:3  To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:4  And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:5  And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:6  This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:7  Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:8  All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:9  I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:10  The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:11  I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:12  But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:13  The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:14  I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:15  As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:16  And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:17  Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:18  No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:19  There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:20  And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? </div>
           <div>Joh 10:21  Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? </div>
           <div>Joh 10:22  And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:23  And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:24  Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:25  Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:26  But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:27  My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: </div>
           <div>Joh 10:28  And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:29  My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:30  I and my Father are one. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:31  Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:32  Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? </div>
           <div>Joh 10:33  The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:34  Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? </div>
           <div>Joh 10:35  If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; </div>
           <div>Joh 10:36  Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? </div>
           <div>Joh 10:37  If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:38  But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:39  Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand, </div>
           <div>Joh 10:40  And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:41  And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true. </div>
           <div>Joh 10:42  And many believed on him there. </div>
